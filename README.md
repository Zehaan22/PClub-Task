# PClub-Task
Repository to store the PClub task for the recruitment task of the WEB 3.0 project.\n

This repository has one file that contains the class definition asked for in the project.\n
The object is implemented in 3-d space and some assumptions have been made along the way, like the project being a zero - dimension particle
etc.\n
The file also has some basic test code and the comments on the code are also fairly intuitive. \n
If you find any error , suggestions to make , general comments , do feel free to reach out to me on my mail ID zehaan22@iitk.ac.in.\n
